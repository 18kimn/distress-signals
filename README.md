### Notes on the use of distress signals

A project by Yifan Wang and Nathan Kim on the use of distress signals. Yifan
created a zine project on distress signals; I set up this website as an
accompaniment to play sounds in response to NFC tags embedded in the zine.

The website is hosted at
[https://distress-signals.org](https://distress-signals.org/).

To play a sound, the NFC tags should have text in them:

1. mayday
2. sos
3. ship horn
4. electric horn
5. sweep up
6. sweep down

Then, when approached by an NFC-enabled phone while visiting the website, audio
should begin playing.
